    <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow developers to control the layout and presentation of web pages. 
        By using the box model, we can define margins, borders, and padding to create clean and organized designs. 
        Layout techniques help us arrange elements in a way that improves readability and user experience. 
        This flexibility makes CSS a powerful tool in front-end development.
